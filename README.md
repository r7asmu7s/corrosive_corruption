# corrosive_corruption

A project of R Data Science Bootcamp to recreate [Economist's Corrosive Corruption article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2011/12/02/corrosive-corruption)'s visualization with `ggplot2` package.

Latest Corruption Precteptions Index dataset from [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl) and Human Development Index dataset from [United Nations Development Programme](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data) has been gathered, instead of pre-precessed dataset provided in the course materials. Two datasets were merged, cleaned and exported as a `csv` file.
